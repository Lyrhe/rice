Quick and dirty css for Vivaldi, for Nocturnal 10 VS. To set it up :

1. Go to your Vivaldi folder "AppData\Local\Vivaldi\Application\1.0.403.17\resources\vivaldi\" (or the latest version at the time, just take the most recent one.)
2. Edit browser.html, add this line <link rel="stylesheet" href="style/custom.css" /> just before the </head> tag.
3. In the style folder, edit common.css and add this line : @import "custom.css";
4. Put custom.css in the same folder.
5. Put favicon-speeddials.jpg in the resources folder.

It's incomplete and REALLY messy but it'll work. I put comments here and there, so you should be able to edit the colors and stuff.
